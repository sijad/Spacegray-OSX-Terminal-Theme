### Spacegray Theme For Mac Terminal

Some customizations to [Tannadev's Spacegray Theme](https://github.com/tannadev/Spacegray-OSX-Terminal-Theme) to make it more comfortable for myself

#### Setup:

Launch Terminal

In the top menu bar click Terminal -> Preferences (or âŒ˜,)

Go to "Profiles"

Click the Gear symbol

Click Import...

Click spacegray.terminal and press Open

Now set the profile as "Default" and you should be good!

##### Extra Info:
I am using a downloaded font called [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)

I am also using [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) for [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) with [Imajes Theme](https://github.com/sijad/imajes-omf-theme) instead of the default shells
